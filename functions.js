//You see repetition, you make a function
// const movie1 = 'Saving Private Ryan';
// const year1 = 1998;
// console.log(`${movie1} was released in ${year1}`);

// const movie2 = 'Interstellar';
// const year2 = 2014;
// console.log(`${movie2} was released in ${year2}`);

// const movie3 = 'Jason Bourne';
// const year3 = 2016;
// console.log(`${movie3} was released in ${year3}`);

// const printMovie = (movie, year) => {
// console.log(`${movie} was released in ${year}`)
// }

// printMovie('Saving Private Ryan', 1998);
// printMovie('Interstellar', 2014);
// printMovie('Jason Bourne', 2016);
